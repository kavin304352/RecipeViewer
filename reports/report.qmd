# README

A quality README is an important part of EVERY project. Using the Quarto *include* command we're including a copy of your README in the project report so that a human can evaluate it.

Make sure that you edit the README so that it's explanatory!  Note that you don't need a readme within the *reports* folder for this assignment. We're only
focused on the root *README.md*.

[Here is some info](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) on how to write a good README!
